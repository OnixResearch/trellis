## Collections

r[collections.sorted-insert]
Inserting into a sorted sequence MUST produce a sorted sequence containing
all original elements plus the new element.

r[collections.binary-search]
Binary search on a sorted sequence MUST return the index of the target if
present, or None if absent. It MUST NOT access indices outside the sequence

associative, and idempotent. min(a, b) <= max(a, b) MUST hold.

r[ordering.median-of-three]
median_of_three MUST return the middle value of three inputs. The result
MUST be bounded by the overall min and max of the three values. The median
of three equal values MUST be that value.

r[ordering.sign]
sign MUST return -1 if a < b, 0 if a == b, and 1 if a > b.
sign MUST be antisymmetric: sign(a, b) == -sign(b, a).

r[ordering.compare-and-swap]
compare_and_swap MUST return (min(a,b), max(a,b)). The first element MUST
be less than or equal to the second. Both input values MUST be preserved.

## Cross-Module Properties

r[properties.abs-diff-zero-iff-equal]
abs_diff(a, b) MUST equal zero if and only if a equals b.

r[properties.add-sub-roundtrip]
When a + b does not overflow, saturating_sub(saturating_add(a, b), b) MUST
return a. Addition and subtraction MUST be inverse operations within bounds.

r[properties.clamp-nearest-point]
For any x in [lo, hi], clamp(value, lo, hi) MUST be at least as close to
value as x is. Clamp returns the nearest point in the range.

r[properties.clamp-monotonic]
Clamp MUST be monotonic: if a <= b then clamp(a, lo, hi) <= clamp(b, lo, hi).

r[properties.distance-decomposition]
For any value in [lo, hi], the distances to the endpoints MUST sum to the
range width: abs_diff(value, lo) + abs_diff(value, hi) == abs_diff(lo, hi).

r[properties.sub-add-inverse]
When b <= a, saturating_add(saturating_sub(a, b), b) MUST return a.

r[properties.toggle-involution]
Toggling a bit twice MUST return the original value for any input and
any valid bit position.

r[properties.min-max-abs-diff]

max is the absolute difference.

r[properties.clamp-via-min-max]
clamp(v, lo, hi) MUST equal min(max(v, lo), hi) when lo <= hi. Clamp is
expressible as nested min/max.

r[properties.align-down-remainder]
x - align_down(x, a) MUST equal x % a. The distance from x to the
aligned-down value is the remainder.

r[properties.align-up-via-div-ceil]
When align_up(x, a) is defined, it MUST equal div_ceil(x, a) * a. Rounding
up to an alignment is ceiling division times the alignment.

r[properties.median-is-clamp]

The median is a clamped value.

r[properties.all-equal-implies-count]
If all_equal(s, v) holds, count_matches(s, v) MUST equal s.len(). Every
element matching means the count is the full length.

r[properties.chunk-count-div-ceil]
div_ceil(n, k) MUST equal chunk_count(n, k) + 1 when n has a remainder
mod k, and chunk_count(n, k) when it divides evenly. Floor and ceiling
division differ by exactly the presence of a remainder.

r[properties.narrow-iff-in-range]
narrow_u32(x).is_some() MUST hold if and only if in_range(x, 0, u32::MAX)
holds. Checked narrowing and range predicates MUST agree.

r[properties.all-equal-implies-partitioned]
If all_equal(s, v) holds, is_partitioned(s, threshold) MUST hold for any
threshold. A uniform sequence is trivially partitioned.

r[properties.majority-via-div-ceil]
majority(n) MUST equal div_ceil(n + 1, 2) for all n > 0. The majority
threshold is ceiling division of (n+1) by 2.

r[properties.epoch-ge-term-index]
epoch_ge(a, b) MUST imply a.term > b.term, or a.term == b.term and
a.index >= b.index. The lexicographic comparison decomposes into term
and index conditions.

r[properties.log-prefix-term-eq]
If logs_match_prefix(a, b, k) holds, the term sequences of a and b
MUST be equal over [0, k). Log term-agreement is equivalent to prefix
equality on the projected term sequence.

unwrap_or_default MUST return the contained value if Some, or the provided
default if None.

r[option.map-preserves-none]

r[option.and-then]
and_then MUST apply `f` to the contained value if Some, returning its
result. and_then on None MUST return None. and_then MUST satisfy the

and_then(opt, Some) == opt.

r[option.or-else]
or_else MUST return the option unchanged if Some. or_else on None MUST
return the fallback value. or_else with a Some fallback MUST always
yield Some.

not. filter on None MUST return None. filter MUST be idempotent:
filter(filter(opt, p), p) == filter(opt, p).

## Result Combinators

r[result.unwrap-or]
unwrap_or MUST return the Ok value if present, or the provided default
if Err.

r[result.map-ok]
map_ok MUST apply `f` to the Ok value, leaving Err untouched. map_ok
MUST satisfy the functor composition law. map_ok and map_err MUST
commute: the order of application does not matter.

r[result.map-err]
map_err MUST apply `f` to the Err value, leaving Ok untouched.

r[result.and-then]
and_then on Ok(v) MUST apply `f`, returning its result. and_then on
Err(e) MUST propagate the error unchanged. and_then MUST satisfy the
monad right identity: and_then(res, Ok) == res.

r[result.or-else]

the fallback. or_else with an Ok fallback MUST always yield Ok.

slices are equal. When n is zero, prefix_eq MUST return true. When n
exceeds either slice length, prefix_eq MUST return false.

r[slice.suffix-eq]
suffix_eq MUST return true if and only if the last `n` elements of both
slices are equal. When n is zero, suffix_eq MUST return true. When n
exceeds either slice length, suffix_eq MUST return false.

r[slice.all-equal]
all_equal MUST return true if and only if every element in the slice
equals the given value. all_equal on an empty slice MUST return true.

r[slice.mismatch-index]
mismatch_index MUST return the index of the first position where two
slices differ, comparing up to the shorter length. MUST return None if
all compared elements match. mismatch_index of two empty slices MUST
return None.

now_ms > expires_at_ms. At the exact expiration time, the entry is NOT
expired.

r[expiration.is-expired-opt]
is_expired_opt(expires_at_ms, now_ms) MUST return false when expires_at_ms
is None (no TTL means never expires). When Some, MUST delegate to
is_expired.

r[expiration.time-remaining]
time_remaining(expires_at_ms, now_ms) MUST return None when expires_at_ms
is None. MUST return Some(0) when already expired. MUST return

Appending a correctly-hashed entry to a valid chain MUST produce a valid
chain. All prior entries MUST remain valid.

## Batch Limits

r[batch.check-limits]

MUST produce the same state as applying B then A when their indices
differ. Reading a position not targeted by a write MUST return the
original value.

Once a threshold is crossed in a monotonic sequence, it stays crossed — no later adjacent pair can cross the same threshold.

r[properties.budget-warning-implies-not-ok]
Warning status implies we are past Ok — the two states are mutually exclusive.

r[properties.budget-exceeded-stays-exceeded]
Exceeded is absorbing under increasing totals — once exceeded, always exceeded.

## Environment Scrubbing

Common safe variable names (PATH, HOME) MUST NOT be in the blocklist and MUST NOT match any secret suffix.

r[env-scrub.empty-yields-marker]
Filtering an empty key list MUST yield zero safe entries.

## Cross-module: Environment Scrubbing

If variant a does not subsume variant b, then no capability of type a can authorize operations of type b. Leaf variants MUST NOT subsume Full. Independent variants (Prompt, ToolUse, Delegate) MUST NOT subsume each other.

## Authorization Composition

r[authorize.decomposition]
authorizes(cap, op) MUST equal subsumes(cap.variant, op.variant) && covers(cap.scope, op.target) && mode_permits(cap.mode, op.mode). Each factor is independently verified.

r[authorize.rejects-scope-failure]
Scope mismatch MUST deny even with matching variant and mode.

r[authorize.rejects-mode-failure]
Mode mismatch MUST deny even with matching variant and scope.

r[authorize.rejects-variant-failure]
Variant mismatch MUST deny even with matching scope and mode.

r[authorize.all-match]
When all three factors match, authorization MUST succeed.

r[authorize.compound-scope]
Authorization with compound scope MUST require mount equality and prefix coverage. Mount mismatch MUST deny.

r[authorize.optional-constraint]
Authorization with optional constraint: None cap constraint MUST NOT block. Some cap with None target MUST block.

## Delegation Containment

r[containment.decomposition]
contains(parent, child) MUST equal subsumes(parent.variant, child.variant) && covers(parent.scope, child.scope) && mode_le(child.mode, parent.mode).

r[containment.no-scope-widening]
If the parent scope does not cover the child scope, containment MUST fail.

r[containment.no-mode-escalation]
If the child mode is not ≤ the parent mode, containment MUST fail.

r[containment.no-variant-escalation]
If the parent variant does not subsume the child variant, containment MUST fail.

r[containment.transitive]
Containment MUST be transitive, following from transitivity of each factor.

r[containment.self-contained]
Every capability MUST contain itself.

r[containment.attenuation-allowed]
A child with narrower scope and equal-or-lower mode MUST be contained by the parent.

r[containment.compound-scope]
Compound containment MUST require mount equality. Mount mismatch MUST deny.

r[containment.optional-constraint]
Optional containment: parent None MUST contain any child. Parent Some MUST block child None.

## Delegation Chain

r[delegation.depth-bounded]
Chain depth MUST NOT exceed MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH (8). Depths 0-8 are valid, 9+ are invalid.

r[delegation.root-depth-zero]
Root tokens MUST have depth 0.

r[delegation.depth-increments]
Each delegation level MUST increment depth by exactly 1.

r[delegation.delegate-gate]
Delegation MUST require the parent to hold the Delegate capability. Without Delegate, delegation is denied.

r[delegation.chain-attenuation]
Each parent-to-child transition MUST attenuate: parent variant subsumes child, child mode <= parent mode. Escalation on either axis MUST be rejected.

r[delegation.chain-valid]
A full chain is valid iff: non-empty, root at depth 0, last depth within bounds, and every consecutive pair passes level validation.

## Token Timestamps

r[token-timestamp.expiration-tolerance]
A token is expired when now > expires_at + tolerance. Saturating addition MUST prevent overflow. Within the tolerance window, the token MUST NOT be expired. Zero tolerance means expired iff now > expires_at.

r[token-timestamp.fresh-token-valid]
A token checked at its issued_at time with issued_at <= expires_at MUST NOT be expired.

r[token-timestamp.expiration-monotonic]
Once a token is expired, it MUST stay expired as time advances.

r[token-timestamp.future-rejection]
A token with issued_at > now + tolerance MUST be rejected as from the future. Clock skew within tolerance MUST be accepted.

r[token-timestamp.refresh-threshold]
A token needs refresh when remaining lifetime <= 20% of total lifetime. Expired tokens always need refresh. Fresh tokens (at issued_at) MUST NOT need refresh.

r[token-timestamp.token-valid]
A token is temporally valid iff not expired and not from the future. A well-formed token checked at its issued_at time MUST be valid.

## Cross-module: UCAN Authorization

r[properties.delegation-safety]
If a parent contains a capability and that capability authorizes an operation, then the parent also authorizes the operation. Delegation cannot create new access.

r[properties.auth-implies-subsumes]
Authorization implies all three factors hold: variant subsumption, scope coverage, and mode permission.

r[properties.containment-implies-factors]
Containment implies all three factors hold: variant subsumption, scope coverage, and mode ordering.

r[properties.token-valid-at-issue]
A well-formed token is temporally valid at its issued_at time.

r[properties.chain-valid-implies-depth-bounded]
A valid delegation chain has depth within MAX_DELEGATION_DEPTH (8). Chains exceeding the bound are rejected.

## Region Arithmetic

r[region.contains-addr]
A region (base, size) MUST contain address x iff base <= x < base + size.
Empty regions (size == 0) MUST contain no address. Overflow: base + size
MUST NOT exceed u64::MAX + 1 (enforced via requires).

r[region.end-addr]
The exclusive end address of a region MUST equal base + size.

r[region.is-empty]
A region is empty iff its size is zero.

r[region.disjoint]
Two regions MUST be disjoint iff they share no address. Disjointness
MUST be symmetric.

r[region.contains-region]
Region A contains region B iff every address in B is also in A.
Containment MUST be reflexive and transitive.

r[region.adjacent]
Two regions MUST be adjacent iff one ends exactly where the other
begins, with no gap and no overlap. Adjacency MUST be symmetric.

r[region.merge]
Merging two adjacent regions MUST produce a region covering exactly
the combined span. Split-then-merge MUST be a roundtrip.

r[region.split]
Splitting a region at an offset within (0, size) MUST produce two
non-empty, non-overlapping, adjacent sub-regions whose sizes sum
to the original size.

## Cross-module: Region ↔ Interval

r[properties.region-contains-agrees-interval]
region_contains_addr(base, size, x) MUST agree with interval::contains(base, base+size, x)
for valid (non-overflowing) regions.

r[properties.region-disjoint-agrees-interval]
regions_disjoint(a_base, a_size, b_base, b_size) MUST agree with
!interval::overlaps(a_base, a_end, b_base, b_end) for valid regions.

r[properties.region-adjacent-agrees-interval]
region_adjacent(a_base, a_size, b_base, b_size) MUST agree with
interval::adjacent(a_base, a_end, b_base, b_end) for valid regions.

## Slab Allocation

r[slab.slot-index]
slot_index MUST return (addr - base) / slot_size for addresses within the slab region.
The slot index MUST be bounded: slot_index < slab_capacity.

r[slab.slot-offset]
slot_offset MUST return (addr - base) % slot_size, the byte position within a slot.

r[slab.slot-address]
slot_address MUST return base + index * slot_size. On aligned addresses,
slot_address(slot_index(addr)) MUST equal addr (roundtrip).

r[slab.is-slot-aligned]
An address is slot-aligned iff its slot_offset is zero.

r[slab.slab-capacity]
slab_capacity MUST return region_size / slot_size — the number of whole
slots that fit. Zero slot_size or region_size MUST yield zero.

r[slab.generation-valid]
A generation is valid if it is less than a maximum generation limit.
generation_increment MUST produce a valid successor. Validity MUST be
monotonic: if gen is invalid, gen+1 is also invalid.

r[slab.handle-pack]
handle_pack MUST combine an index and generation into a single u64.
handle_unpack_index and handle_unpack_generation MUST recover the
original values (roundtrip).

## Cross-module: Slab ↔ Page

r[properties.slab-slot-is-page-frame]
slot_index(addr, base, slot_size) with base=0 MUST agree with
page::frame_number(addr, slot_size).

r[properties.slab-capacity-is-pages-dual]
For exact multiples: slab_capacity(n * s, s) == n, matching the
inverse relationship with pages_needed.

## Buddy System

r[buddy.block-size]
block_size(order) MUST return 2^order. block_size(0) == 1.

r[buddy.buddy-of]
buddy_of(addr, order) MUST return the buddy address by flipping bit `order`
in addr. buddy_of MUST be an involution: buddy_of(buddy_of(addr, order), order) == addr.

r[buddy.order-for-size]
order_for_size(size) MUST return the minimum order k such that 2^k >= size.
For exact powers of two, order_for_size(2^k) == k.

r[buddy.can-coalesce]
Two blocks can coalesce iff they are buddies at the same order and both
are aligned to that order. Coalescing produces a block at order+1.

r[buddy.parent-block]
parent_block(addr, order) MUST return the start of the parent block at
order+1. The parent is aligned to order+1.

r[buddy.is-aligned-to-order]
An address is aligned to order iff addr % 2^order == 0.

## Cross-module: Buddy ↔ Bitwise/Integer

r[properties.buddy-uses-toggle]
buddy_of(addr, order) MUST equal bitwise::toggle_bit(addr, order).

r[properties.block-size-is-pow2]
block_size(order) MUST equal integer::pow2_spec(order).

## Watermark Allocation

r[watermark.remaining]
watermark_remaining(mark, base, capacity) MUST return capacity - (mark - base).
When mark == base, remaining MUST equal capacity.

r[watermark.fits]
watermark_fits(mark, size, base, capacity) MUST return true iff an allocation
of `size` bytes fits in the remaining space.

r[watermark.alloc]
watermark_alloc(mark, size) MUST return the new mark after allocating `size` bytes
(mark + size). The allocation occupies [mark, mark + size).

r[watermark.reset]
watermark_reset returns the base address. After reset, remaining == capacity.

r[watermark.is-empty]
The watermark is empty (no allocations) when mark == base.

r[watermark.monotonic]
Allocation only moves the mark forward: new_mark >= old_mark.

r[watermark.non-overlap]
Two successive allocations from the same watermark return disjoint regions.

r[watermark.capacity-conservation]
remaining + used == capacity, where used = mark - base.

## Cross-module: Watermark

r[properties.watermark-advance-is-monotonic]
watermark_alloc advances the mark, which satisfies monotonic::is_advance.

r[properties.watermark-alloc-disjoint-regions]
Two allocations from sequential marks produce regions that are
region::regions_disjoint.
